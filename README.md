This application provides users the chance to predict the outcome of the NCAA tournament. Users are able to login into the application place their predictions through a simple GUI that allouws them to decide which teams will win matches and move on to next rounds. After the user completes a bracket the program is capable of simulating the torunament. At the end the user's prediction gets graded depending on how well the user predicted the outcome of the games. Also, to make it more fun the user is able to see how many points he or she scored and also how many points other users got.

This is  how the GUI looks:
